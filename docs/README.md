OctoAcme runs projects using a lightweight, lifecycle-driven approach that emphasizes clear goals, iterative delivery, and measurable outcomes. Each initiative starts with a Project One‑pager that defines the problem, objective, success metrics, stakeholders, and a high-level timeline to support a go/no-go decision. Projects then move through planning (kickoff, prioritized backlog, estimates, Definition of Done), execution (incremental delivery with CI-backed PRs), release (pre-release checks, smoke tests, rollback plan) and close (retrospective and action items). See the detailed project guides in this folder for templates and checklists.

Workflows are standardized to keep execution predictable and traceable. Teams use a project board with columns like Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done and follow a disciplined pull request process (small PRs, link to issue and acceptance criteria, automated tests and linting in CI, at least one approval). Planning practices include backlog templates, timeboxed sprint planning, release milestone mapping, and a simple Risk Register to capture impacts, likelihoods, and owners. Cross-team dependencies and blockers are surfaced in weekly syncs and escalated using the documented escalation path.

Roles and responsibilities are clearly defined to ensure ownership and reduce ambiguity. A Project Manager coordinates delivery, risk, and communications while a Product Manager defines outcomes and prioritizes the backlog. Developers implement features, write tests, and participate in reviews; QA validates acceptance criteria and supports pre-release verification. These personas and their responsibilities are documented so every artifact and ceremony has an owner.

Communication and quality assurance are baked into cadence and artifacts. Regular rhythms (daily standups, weekly delivery syncs, PM+PdM alignment, sprint demos, and monthly stakeholder updates) keep stakeholders informed and surface issues early. QA practices require unit and integration tests, end‑to‑end smoke tests for critical flows, security scanning in CI, and manual QA when appropriate; pre‑release smoke tests and a documented rollback plan are required before production deploys. Incident and blocker escalation follow a tiered path (team → PM → Product Lead → Sponsor) with incident communications and blameless retrospectives to capture improvements.
